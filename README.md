# Project-Euler
C# and Bash solutions for some [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.

## Description
I worked through the first 25 Project Euler problems a while back when I was in college. They've languished on my hard disk ever since. These solutions are provided here without commentary on an as-is. These aren't the most spectacular or efficient solutions.

24 of the 25 solutions were coded in C# and one in Linux Bash.

## What's Included
Not much. Solutions along with text files, where relevant.
